<h1>YikesBot</h1>

<body>
  <p>This is a bot for discord that is both user friendly and looks great. This is my first project and I am learning Python in the       progess</p>
   
  <p>At the moment I am looking to have the bot search youtube for videos and play the audio in the voice channel.
     I would also like to create a pleasent and intuitive UI/UX (within the limits of the bot)</p>
